**Overview**
-This project is a React application designed to simulate the movement of a vehicle on a map from a starting point to an endpoint. The application allows users to input various parameters such as speed, frames per second (fps), and coordinates for the starting and ending points. Using the Leaflet library for map rendering, the application visually animates the movement of a marker representing the vehicle along the route.

**Features**
-Dynamic Animation: The application calculates the movement of the marker based on the given speed and updates its position accordingly.

-Interactive Inputs: Users can customize parameters such as speed, fps, and coordinates of the starting and ending points through an interactive interface.

-Pause and Restart: Users have the ability to pause and restart the animation at any point during the trip.

-Real-time Updates: The application provides real-time updates on the remaining time until the end of the trip.

-Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

**Technologies Used**
-React: The frontend framework used to build the application, providing a component-based architecture for efficient development.

-Leaflet: An open-source JavaScript library used for interactive maps, facilitating the visualization of the vehicle's movement.

-React Icons: Provides a collection of icons that enhance the user interface and experience.

-Tailwind CSS: Custom styling is applied using CSS to ensure a visually appealing and responsive layout.

**Deployment**
The application is hosted using Render, a cloud platform that simplifies the deployment of web applications. You can access the live site .
